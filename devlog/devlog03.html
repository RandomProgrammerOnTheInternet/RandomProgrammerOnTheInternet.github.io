			Wow. I think I just entered side project hell.
		</p>
		<p>
			I used to have like one main side project, C==. I postponed my game until i finished C==, and the other stuff were mainly just random stuff.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now, I just made 2 more side projects in less than a week. A terminal game engine called Tangerine, and a desktop environment in the terminal (which depends on Tangerine).

			plz helb.
