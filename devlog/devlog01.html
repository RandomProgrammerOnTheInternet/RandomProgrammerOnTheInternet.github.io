            Yeah so I created this website yesterday. I don't know why. Maybe
            because I was learning HTML for a secret Iraqi project. Whatever.

            I recently unbound esc and enter on my vim. I am not insane. Instead of
            esc, I'm using ^J. It does the same thing but is closer to my hands. Also,
            esc is really far away so I'm using jk instead.
        </p>

            I keep on pressing esc and enter and wondering why it wont work before
            realizing I unbound those keys.

            Also, Emacs sucks.
